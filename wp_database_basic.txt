By default, the database has eleven tables.
Database tables have a default prefix wp_ which can be changed at will.

Table 3: wp_links
wp_links takes care of blogrolls (a list of hyperlinks to other blogs or websites) that was fashionable in the past. Now not supported 

Table 4: wp_options
In your WordPress dashboard, there is an option called Setting. wp_options stores data related to that Settings feature. If you select Setting from your WordPress dashboard, you’ll see options that enable you to change site title, tagline, site address (URL), etc. This information is stored in the wp_options table. 

Table 5: wp_postmeta
wp_postmeta stores metadata (like Post ID, meta ID, among other things) for posts and pages. Identification numbers allotted to each post helps to store them in a structured manner. 

Table 6: wp_posts

Table 9: wp_term_taxonomy
wp_term_taxonomy stores descriptions of the taxonomy (tag, link, or category) for the entries in the wp_terms table. 

Table 10: wp_usermeta

Table 11: wp_users
wp_users stores data for WordPress users. How is it different to wp_usermeta? Well, the wp_usermeta table stored unique identification number of users but the wp_users table stores other user information like the Username, User Login Name, Email address, etc.
